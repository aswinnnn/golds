_check out the NSFW commands yourself, im not showing it here _


# Why are there only some commands in cogs?
I have coded a lot of commands partially to cogs and partially in golds.py. 
I'd turn it into cogs if it were'nt for the number of bugs 
i dont wanna deal with since i've moved on to new projects.
if you can turn them into cogs i'd say thanks, just make a pull request! 


# Do i plan on improving golds?
Maybe. since this is an open sourced version, if you want you can add your own commands and make a pull request, im all up for it. 
I've commited around 500 commits in the original, private repository in 5-6 months and I'm pretty proud of it since its my first "kinda big" project.


# Will i keep running my golds bot?
Nah, its the main reason im making the source code public. I'll be taking down golds soon and I believe this can be pretty helpful to someone out there.
